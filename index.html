            <div class="excerpt">
                <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-2xl"></i>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a
                    traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman
                    who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-2xl"></i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class='reflections'>In today’s society, some cultures still believe that women should be subservient to
                their husbands or male members of the family. These gender roles create expectations that women must
                obey their husbands and act according to their wishes and not make their own decisions as men do. This
                was seen in Born a Crime. Abel has these beliefs, but could never fall in love with subservient women.
                This is a result of the desire to control his partner rather than having a genuine desire for
                companionship. Men like him, even in today’s society, always desire women who go against them to
                exercise their power over them. In response to society's gender role expectations, Patricia is a good
                example of a resilient woman who, against all odds, finds her independence and lives up to her desires
                and decisions to build her own life, not what society and her family choose for her.
                In traditional gender roles and relationship expectations for a man and a woman, women are expected to
                care for the household, and men are expected to be the family's breadwinners. This makes it men to be
                believed to do all hard things, and the belief that women are fragile and cannot do some occupations. In
                the past decades, women have shown that they can do what women can do, and society's definitions of
                gender roles have been proven wrong. This is mostly in cities, but rural areas still have those beliefs.
                This does not mean that the society fully embraces independent women; to some men, this becomes a threat
                in their belief that they are losing their control over women, which they have always desired. This is
                also seen in Patricia’s life, when Abel couldn’t fully control Patricia, he became violent due to his
                insecurities that he was losing his power as a man, as Patricia was the opposite of what he expected of
                her.
